//we are able to modify property here
// there was no way to create private field in js few year ago
// so we put _ brfore the variable name it indicates that you should not touvh that property because it is private 
// but there was no restriction anyone can change it
// example- firstName  _firstName
const user1 = new CreateUser("vikas", "sahni", 21);
console.log(user1);
console.log(user1._firstName);
user1._firstName = "-"
console.log(user1._firstName);


// JS introduced private field few time ago. if a property is private property then we cant even change it by any way
class CreateUser2 {
    #firstName
    constructor(firstName, lastName, age) {
        this.#firstName = firstName
        this.lastName = lastName
        this.age = age

const user2 = new CreateUser2("akash", "sahni", 23);
const user3 = new CreateUser2("yadav", "umesh", 230);

console.log("**************************************");

console.log(user2);
//user2.#firstName=""   // giving error: Private field '#firstName' must be declared in an enclosing class
// Yes, due to recent updates in the DevTools now you'll be able access the private properties using # in the console.
// But if you try to access private property in the JavaScript file it will give error.
